Practical Common Lisp
=====================

This is minor modification of the Practical Common Lisp book
available for free at http://gigamonkeys.com/book .

These are the three major changes in this code base:
- [ ] Changes to the links to work when the index.html is opened
      as `file://`
- [ ] Turned the footnotes into links, along with return links.
- [ ] Added links on bottom of each chapter to return to the TOC.
